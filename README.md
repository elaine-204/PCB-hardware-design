# PCB-hardware-design
This project involves the design and layout of a 2-layer PCB for an inverting amplifier circuit implemented using two LMC6084 quad CMOS op-amp ICs, resulting in multiple amplifier outputs.
The complete schematic capture and PCB layout were done in Altium Designer. Design rule checks (DRC) and electrical rule checks (ERC) were performed, and fabrication-ready Gerber files were generated.
